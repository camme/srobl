# Swedish Robot Language (srobl)

This is just a try at writing a pegjs grammar to create a simple languge understandable by children to program a robot

Use it with [peg](http://pegjs.org/) as the parser. 

The interpreter will be added soon and will communicate through [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five)
